# Property sets [![Build Status](https://github.com/zendesk/property_sets/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zendesk/property_sets/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This gem is a way for you to use a basic "key/value" store for storing attributes for a given model in a relational fashion where there's a row per attribute. Alternatively you'd need to add a new column per attribute to your main table, or serialize the attributes and their values using the [Active Record Store](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Store.html).

## Description

You configure the allowed stored properties by specifying these in the model:

```ruby
class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  property_set :settings do
    property :version, :default => "v1.0"
    property :featured, :protected => true
    property :activated
  end

  property_set :texts do
    property :epilogue
  end
end
```

The declared properties can then be accessed runtime via the defined association:

```ruby
# Return the value of the version record for this account, or the default value if not set
account.settings.version

# Update the version record with given value
account.settings.version = "v1.1"

# Query the truth value of the property
account.settings.featured?

# Short hand for setting one or more values
account.settings.set(:version => "v1.2", :activated => true)

# Short hand for getting a hash with pairs for each key argument
account.settings.get([:version, :activated])
```

You can also forward read, write and query methods to the properties with `PropertySets::Delegator`.

```ruby
class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  include PropertySets::Delegator
  delegate_to_property_set :settings, :is_open => :open, :same => :same
end

account.open #=> account.settings.is_open
```

These classes and their subclasses will inherit specified properties.

### Validations

Property sets supports standard AR validations, although in a somewhat manual fashion.

```ruby
class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  property_set :settings do
    property :version, :default => "v1.0"
    property :featured, :protected => true

    validates_format_of :value, :with => /v\d+\.\d+/, :message => "of version is invalid",
                        :if => Proc.new { |r| r.name.to_sym == :version }
  end
end
```

On `account.save` this will result in an error record being added. You can also inspect the
setting record using `account.settings.version_record`

### Bulk operations

Stored properties can also be updated with the update_attributes and update_attributes! methods by
enabling nested attributes. Like this (from the test cases):

```ruby
@account.texts_attributes = [
  { :name => "foo", :value => "1"  },
  { :name => "bar", :value => "0"  }
]
```

And for existing records:

```ruby
@account.update_attributes!(:texts_attributes => [
  { :id => @account.texts.foo.id, :name => "foo", :value => "0"  },
  { :id => @account.texts.bar.id, :name => "bar", :value => "1" }
])
```

Using nested attributes is subject to implementing your own security measures for mass update assignments.
Alternatively, it is possible to use a custom hash structure:

```ruby
params = {
  :settings => { :version => "v4.0", :featured => "1" },
  :texts    => { :epilogue => "Wibble wobble" }
}

@account.update_attributes(params)
```

The above will not update `featured` as this has the protected flag set and is hence protected from
mass updates.

### View helpers

We support a couple of convenience mechanisms for building forms and putting the values into the above hash structure. So far, only support check boxes and radio buttons:

```erb
<% form_for(:account, :html => { :method => :put }) do |f| %>
  <h3><%= f.property_set(:settings).check_box :activated %> Activated?</h3>
  <h3><%= f.property_set(:settings).radio_button :hot, "yes" %> Hot</h3>
  <h3><%= f.property_set(:settings).radio_button :not, "no" %> Not</h3>
  <h3><%= f.property_set(:settings).select :level, [["One", 1], ["Two", 2]] %></h3>
<% end %>
```

## Installation

Install the gem in your rails project by putting it in your Gemfile:

```
gem "property_sets"
```

Also remember to create the storage table(s), if for example you are going to be using this with an accounts model and a "settings" property set, you can define the table like:

```ruby
create_table :account_settings do |t|
  t.integer :account_id, :null => false
  t.string  :name, :null => false
  t.string  :value
  t.timestamps
end

add_index :account_settings, [ :account_id, :name ], :unique => true
```

If you would like to serialize larger objects into your property sets, you can use a `TEXT` column type for value like this:

```ruby
create_table :account_settings do |t|
  t.integer :account_id, :null => false
  t.string  :name, :null => false
  t.text    :value
  t.timestamps
end

add_index :account_settings, [ :account_id, :name ], :unique => true
```

### Storage table(s) on separate databases

By default, `property_sets` looks for the storage table(s) on the same database as the model. If you need the storage tables to live on a different database you can configure a custom connection class on a per-model basis:

``` ruby
class MainConnectionClass < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.abstract_class = true

  connects_to(database: { writing: foo })
end

class SeparateDatabase < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.abstract_class = true

  connects_to(database: { writing: bar })
end

class Account < MainConnectionClass
  # Ensure you set this _before_ configuring the property sets.
  self.property_sets_connection_class = SeparateDatabase

  property_set :settings do
    property :foo
  end
end
```

In the above example, the `Accounts` table would live on the `foo` database and the storage table(s) will be written to the `bar` database.
